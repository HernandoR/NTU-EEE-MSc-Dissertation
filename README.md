# NTU EEE Dissertation Latex Template
Nanyang Technological University EEE School, Latex template for Master dissertation report.

Refine based on [W.M. Zhao's version](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ntu-master-dissertation/ngnhrrwryccv)

## GUIDLINE

This version is re-defined based on the newest EEE official dissertation guidline document available at [HERE](https://eeen40028.eee.ntu.edu.sg/graduate/forms/Coursework/Student/PDFs/Guidelines/Diss_Guideline.pdf)

Add features like 1.5 line-spacing, all the statements and page numer, chapter header etc.

## USAGE

The main entry is the `main.tex`. Can just edit the text everywhere around. Didn't make into a `.cls` style file because basically it's a standard latex report.
